              The first question of people who hear me saying that I worked
              professionally with both - Angular and React, is: ‚ÄúSo.. what do
              you think ‚Äî Angular or React??‚Äù ‚Äî I find that my answer about this
              issue has been changed over the years. Why? Let‚Äôs see! ü§î
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my web journey back in 2013, the time when jQuery was
              THE library for JavaScript development. It was extremely hard to
              write reusable code ‚Äî and my codebases became so messy and hard to
              maintain in a short time ü•¥.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later on, React and Angular were introduced, but people were not
              in a rush to adopt them until 2016 when they were a little bit
              more mature. Check the trend chart below:
            </p>

            <h2>
              <strong>My pick at 2016 </strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
              I started with Angular 2 ‚Äî Back in 2016, The Angular team released
              a Beta version. It arrived with big changes to the frontend world,
              and I really liked the following improvements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Awesome documentation</strong> ‚Äî The Angular
                documentation was, and still - very straightforward. The
                learning process is very friendly and easy to get started with.
                I found the official documentation tutorial of Tour of Heroes a
                very fun way to learn the platform practically.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Classes</strong> ‚Äî When you have some kind of ‚Äútemplate‚Äù
                to code in, the less likely you will be exposed to bugs while
                being able to dive into different sections in the code faster.
                When everyone knows they have to structure the code as classes,
                it‚Äôs much easier to understand each module location and code
                execution flow. In React, it was a mix of classes and functional
                components. If you decided that your component should manage
                state, you had to convert it to a class. If you decide state is
                not needed and want to move it to parent, should it stay a class
                or move it back to functional components? so many decisions to
                make! Today ‚Äî I love using only functional components because
                they are small, fast to code, and can do anything a class
                component does.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>TypeScript Integration</strong> ‚Äî When creating a new
                Angular app, the default was Typescript (and still is, who the
                hell is using JavaScript with Angular??), and it was a brand new
                thing to learn along with Angular itself. It feels very natural
                and it plays really well with classes (‚ÄúWow! Is it frontend or
                JAVA??‚Äù). Defining the output result type to each function or
                variable may seem a burden to some people, but the power it
                gives totally worth it: Fail-fast, Easier to understand what the
                engineer who coded this function wants.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dependency Injection</strong> ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just making
                life easier by using a shared service for multiple components or
                a specific module, it also handy for isolating classes during
                testing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>RxJS ‚Äî Dealing</strong> with HTTP in an event-driven way
                using Observables is.. almost a game-changer. The ability to
                make operations and processing on streams of data in an easy,
                intuitive way is a time saver! (and some lines of code,
                sometimes much more..)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Back to my story, I started working on multiple projects from
              scratch and wrote them using Angular. The API has changed A LOT
              since the beta version, and I must say that the Angular team did a
              great job making the APIs much easier while reducing boilerplate
              code needed when creating a component, service, DI, a unit test ‚Äî
              and connecting all those parts in different modules.
            </p>
            <h2>The fight of React (2018)</h2>
            <p>
              When I tried to play with React back in that time.. it felt like
              there is no ‚Äúformal‚Äù / clear way of doing things: everyone is
              writing code everywhere, the structure of the application is
              totally different in each project, It was lacking TypeScript
              support (and examples), and managing state was a big burden ‚Äî even
              with redux (SO many different files for managing state: reducers,
              actions, store) while I could do the same in one-liner using
              Angular (Services + RxJS).
            </p>
            <p>
              But ‚Äî since then ‚Äî the React team went in the right direction by
              introducing hooks and context API as well as better Typescript
              integration! For me, it was a big game-changer since it reduced
              the amount of boilerplate code needed for state management. Why
              use 3rd library like redux when you can just use useState,
              useReducer, and useContext which comes natively with it? React
              became a state management library as well!
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides, I could write all my components in no time and make them
              reusable more than ever (custom hooks). The need to create
              class-based components to manage state and mix them with
              functional components ‚Äî has gone, and I could just create
              functional components really fast and attach state easily using
              useState, useReducer, and useContext.

              For me, it improved the React development experience so much, that
              I fell in love with React although I had a deep, long relationship
              with Angular and decided to use it in more of my projects. I think
              that there are some other people out there that think like me, and
              you can see it in the Stackoverflow trends in the chart above üòé

            <h2>So.. Angular or React?</h2>

              I used both in enterprise-grade applications, and I can say one
              thing: You can do the same in both, and it only depends on YOU ‚Äî
              how you use it. Both, Angular and React, have all the tools to
              keep your code DRY, clean, well-organized, and performant. Also,
              keep in mind to keep your components as small as possible. I
              believe that you should use the framework in which your team is
              more confident and comfortable, along with its ecosystem. If
              things are turning out to be slow, it doesn‚Äôt mean you need to
              change the library you are using ‚Äîbut just learn how to find those
              performance bottlenecks and make the right optimization (Which
              usually comes from rendering/re-rendering too many elements in one
              shot). If you have any additional comments/questions regarding my
              experience or generally on Angular / React war, feel free to hit
              me up in the comments.
